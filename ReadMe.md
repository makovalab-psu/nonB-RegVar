This repository contains the computational scripts used in the manuscript "**Non-B DNA: A major contributor to small- and large-scale variation in nucleotide substitution frequencies across the genome**" by Guiblet, Cremona, et al.

- Supplementary Code 1 contains the scripts used for the large-scale analysis.

- Supplementary Code 2 contains the scipts used for the small-scale analysis.

Please note that multiple scripts are given a name and should not be run within the Jupyter notebook. Such scripts should be built on your local machine and run with command line.
